I'm James Hoey and am currently working as a Teaching Fellow at the University of Leicester. In April 2020 I was offically awarded my PhD. My thesis centres on Reversible Computation of Concurrent Imperative programs, demonstrating a method of running such programs in reverse that is proved to be correct.

Research Interests
======
My main research interest is the field of Reversibile Computation. Traditional computation executes forwards only, with information typically lost throughout an execution. The ability to "execute" a program in reverse is desirable due to the many possible applications. Recreating previous program states is crucial for debugging, a time-consuming task that is difficult for concurrent programs as executions are not always easy to reproduce ("random" execution order). Optimistic forms of event simulation require events to be "rolled back" if the previous execution is later found to be invalid (too optimistic). Such applications require methods that support widely-used and traditional programming languages (saving information to make it reversibile) and reversible programming languages (only reversible programs can be written e.g. Janus). Other potential applications include to energy efficient computation (Landauer's Principle), Cyber Security and Quantum Computing.
