**Abstract:** Software plays a central role in all aspects of reversible computing. We survey the breadth of topics and recent activities on reversible software and systems including behavioural types, recovery, debugging, concurrency, and object-oriented programming. These have the potential to provide linguistic abstractions and tools that will lead to safer and more reliable reversible computing applications.
